<h2 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! This is yuhuiX.</h2>

I'm a **Javascript Fullstack Developer** (now more on the backend side). Love **Node.js** and **TypeScript**.

I built my own basic [CMS](https://github.com/yuhuiX/cms) tool, generating HTML files from JSON files, in order to build well-minified FE files, and making large-scale find-and-replace easier.
Update my own [blog](https://yuhuix.github.io/hugo/), not that frequent, using Hugo, to share what I have read, and what I have learnt.
Iâ€™m currently working on **NetSuite** projects, by adopting with the latest JS tools, such as TypeScript, unit test, CI/CD.

Big fan of DevOps.
Love rules in team work.
Think, before type anything.

Occationally I try some fancy JS/TS libraries and frameworks, even using them in smaller personal leisure projects.
Planned in 2020 to have gain more experience in the 3 big frameworks, Angular, Vue.js, and React, in FE (and also the BE).

Looking forward to solve more problems with JS, and build more useful products in JS.
I love the vacations in Japan, would love to live there for a longer time!
